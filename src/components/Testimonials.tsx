            Outstanding Progress-Driven Developer â€“ Perfect for Phased Projects! I hired Hamza from devdesignfusion to develop a semi-finished backend application using NestJS with SSO integration, and he delivered exactly what I needed! The project was structured as a progress-based milestone (not a fully completed app), and Hamza handled this arrangement flawlessly. His expertise in Node.js, NestJS, and SSO implementation shone through as he built a clean, scalable foundation for future development. What impressed me most was his ability to adapt to the projectâ€™s phased nature. He maintained clear communication throughout, provided regular updates, and ensured every aspect of the agreed scope was executed meticulously. His code was well-organized, documented, and optimized for scalability, making it easy for my team to take over and build further. Though the project isnâ€™t fully complete (as intended), Hamzaâ€™s work exceeded my expectations for this phase. He respected the budget and timeline, delivered a robust modular foundation, and even offered guidance on next steps. If you need a flexible, skilled backend developer for partial builds, iterative work, or progress-driven collaborations, Hamza is a top-tier choice. 5/5 stars â€“ Transparent, professional, and highly competent. Will hire again for future phases!            </p>
